These are my solutions for some of these coding challenges in Java and Kotlin:
- https://adventofcode.com/2022/
- https://adventofcode.com/2023/

### **NOTE:**

The goal is to preserve each solution in the same state as I first submitted the right answers. So no refactoring after successful submission.

I think this way it will be more interesting to look back on these in the future and think about the initial thought process and how rough some first iterations can be.
If I'd be to refactor the solutions in the future, the updated ones will be under separate files/packages.
